# Refactoring Rule-based Chatbots via Ant Colony Optimization

Chatbot is a tool used widely which enables users to satisfy their needs and inquiries. Chatbot generates responses by interacting with users. Chatbot uses a tree-like structure and moves each node in  the tree according to the usersâ€™ intent. The nodes represent each branch point plausible to the intention. We have focused on rule-based chatbot. Rule-based chatbot is a chatbot that operates in provided rules in advance. It is a simple and effective way to respond to specific situations using a predefined set of rules and generates fixed responses so that the behaviors are predictable. It is mostly used in simple situations where it handles FAQs or provides information on a specific topic. However, the main downside is that the administrator needs to manually modify the rules and it is difficult to determine if the current rules are effective for the users. The purpose of our project is to refactor the rule-based chatbot graph or tree more effectively in terms of administrators and users.
